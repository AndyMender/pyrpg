# pyrpg
Simple, text-based role-playing game written in Python. Currently, a work in progress mostly.

Done so far:
- generating and populating world cells (for testing in pyrpg_mapper.py)

- 'Move' class for player movement in world cells (part of pyrpg_pcactions.py)

- stub of the main game script, including a testing 'game over' condition and player statistics/attributes generation (pyrpg_core.py, statistics generated with pyrpg_charstat.py, 'game over' and other conditions handled by pyrpg_events.py)

- stub of NPC classes for player-to-NPC interactions (pyrpg_charclass.py)

To do's:
- all the rest...

- currently sorting the Move class, testing and linking between world cells
