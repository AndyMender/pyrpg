# This script will store and process monster statistics and attributes.
# A separate script will store and process NPC statistics and attributes.

# The idea is to use a global dictionary or list with embedded dictionaries for statistics, attributes, etc.
# Key: value pairs are critical, but order is redundant.

# Optionally, said statistics/attributes will be read from a regular text file.

# Largely WIP!
